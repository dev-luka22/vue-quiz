# Simple Vue Quiz App

This is a simple Quiz App which I made while learning **Vue.js** framework.

It can be improved in numerous ways.

I just wanted to make something simple to see how it all fits together.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
