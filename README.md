# Simple Vue Quiz App

This is a simple Quiz App, which I made while I was learning **Vue.js** framework.

It can be improved in numerous ways.

I just wanted to make something simple, and see how it all fits together.

App is responsive and you can check it out on [this link](https://dev-luka22-vue-quiz.netlify.app/).
